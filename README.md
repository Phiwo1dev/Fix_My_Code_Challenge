Fix_My_Code_Challenge

Fix my code is a new type of project, where we jump into an existing code base and fix it!
I downloaded the repository 0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge and use it as initial files for all solutions.
It contains Python, Javascript, Ruby and C.
I did not recode everything, I just fixed it!
